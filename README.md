# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-KNN-PCA-
This program uses a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm I wrote in addition to some Principle Component Analysis and the sklearn breast cancer data set to predict if the cells are malignant or benign.

Both the python version and the jupter notebook google colab version are available. I suggest using jupyter notebook for an easier time if you do not have certain libraries and tools installed on your computer.
